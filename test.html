<p><strong>Add a common tag to each bucket. Activate the tag as a cost allocation tag. Use the AWS Cost Explorer to create a cost report for the tag</strong></p>

<p>Before you begin, your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy must have permission to:
Access the Billing and Cost Management console, Perform the actions s3:GetBucketTagging and s3:PutBucketTagging.</p>

<p>Start by adding a common tag to each bucket. Activate the tag as a cost allocation tag. Use the AWS Cost Explorer to create a cost report for the tag. After you create the cost report, you can use it to review the cost of each bucket that has the cost allocation tag that you created.</p>

<p>You can set up a daily or hourly AWS Cost and Usage report to get more Amazon S3 billing details. However, these reports won't show you who made requests to your buckets. To get more information on certain Amazon S3 billing items, you must enable logging ahead of time. Then, you'll have logs that contain Amazon S3 request details.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Configure AWS Budgets to see the cost against each S3 bucket in the AWS account</strong> - AWS Budgets gives you the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount. You can also use AWS Budgets to set reservation utilization or coverage targets and receive alerts when your metrics drop below the threshold you define. It cannot showcase the cost of each S3 bucket.</p>

<p><strong>Use AWS Simple Monthly Calculator to check the cost against each S3 bucket in your AWS account</strong> - The AWS Simple Monthly Calculator is an easy-to-use online tool that enables you to estimate the monthly cost of AWS services for your use case based on your expected usage. This useful tool helps estimate the cost of resources, but the current use case is not about estimations but being able to understand which bucket is incurring the maximum cost.</p>

<p><strong>Use AWS Trusted Advisor's rich set of best practice checks to configure cost utilization for individual S3 buckets. Trusted Advisor also provides recommendations based on the findings derived from analyzing your AWS cloud architecture</strong> - AWS Trusted Advisor offers a rich set of best practice checks and recommendations across five categories. For Amazon S3 buckets, Trusted Advisor offers checks the following -</p>

<p>1) Checks buckets in Amazon S3 that have open access permissions
2) Checks the logging configuration of Amazon S3 buckets- whether it is enabled and for what duration
3) Checks for Amazon S3 buckets that do not have versioning enabled.</p>

<p>Trusted Advisor cannot however generate reports for costs incurred on S3 buckets.</p>

<p><strong>When you apply a retention period to an object version explicitly, you specify a <code>Retain Until Date</code> for the object version</strong> - You can place a retention period on an object version either explicitly or through a bucket default setting. When you apply a retention period to an object version explicitly, you specify a <code>Retain Until Date</code> for the object version. Amazon S3 stores the Retain Until Date setting in the object version's metadata and protects the object version until the retention period expires.</p>

<p><strong>Different versions of a single object can have different retention modes and periods</strong> - Like all other Object Lock settings, retention periods apply to individual object versions. Different versions of a single object can have different retention modes and periods.</p>

<p>For example, suppose that you have an object that is 15 days into a 30-day retention period, and you PUT an object into Amazon S3 with the same name and a 60-day retention period. In this case, your PUT succeeds, and Amazon S3 creates a new version of the object with a 60-day retention period. The older version maintains its original retention period and becomes deletable in 15 days.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>You cannot place a retention period on an object version through a bucket default setting</strong> - You can place a retention period on an object version either explicitly or through a bucket default setting.</p>

<p><strong>When you use bucket default settings, you specify a <code>Retain Until Date</code> for the object version</strong> - When you use bucket default settings, you don't specify a Retain Until Date. Instead, you specify a duration, in either days or years, for which every object version placed in the bucket should be protected.</p>

<p><strong>The bucket default settings will override any explicit retention mode or period you request on an object version</strong> - If your request to place an object version in a bucket contains an explicit retention mode and period, those settings override any bucket default settings for that object version.</p>

<p><strong>You can't enable termination protection for Spot Instances</strong> - You can't enable termination protection for Spot Instances—a Spot Instance is terminated when the Spot price exceeds the amount you're willing to pay for Spot Instances. However, you can prepare your application to handle Spot Instance interruptions.</p>

<p><strong>To prevent instances that are part of an Auto Scaling group from terminating on scale in, use instance protection</strong> - The DisableApiTermination attribute does not prevent Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling from terminating an instance.

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>The <code>DisableApiTermination</code> attribute prevents you from terminating an instance by initiating shutdown from the instance</strong> - This is false. The <code>DisableApiTermination</code> attribute does not prevent you from terminating an instance by initiating shutdown from the instance</p>

<p><strong>The <code>DisableApiTermination</code> attribute does not prevent you from terminating an instance by initiating shutdown from Amazon EC2 console</strong> - By default, you can terminate your instance using the Amazon EC2 console, command line interface, or API.

<p><strong>Opt for Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host</strong></p>

<p>An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use. Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your existing per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses, including Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, SUSE, and Linux Enterprise Server. Hence, is the right choice for the current requirement.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Opt for Amazon EC2 Dedicated Instance</strong> - Dedicated Instances are Amazon EC2 instances that run in a virtual private cloud (VPC) on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer. Dedicated Instances that belong to different AWS accounts are physically isolated at a hardware level, even if those accounts are linked to a single payer account. However, Dedicated Instances may share hardware with other instances from the same AWS account that are not Dedicated Instances.</p>

<p><strong>Opt for On-Demand instances that are highly available and require no prior planning</strong></p>

<p><strong>Opt for Reserved Instances that allow you to plan and help install the necessary software</strong></p>

<p>You cannot install your own software that needs socket level programming on On-Demand or Reserved Instances.</p>

<p><strong>For Amazon EC2 service, managing guest operating system (including updates and security patches), application software and Security Groups is the responsibility of the customer</strong></p>

<p>Customer responsibility will be determined by the AWS Cloud services that a customer selects. This determines the amount of configuration work the customer must perform as part of their security responsibilities. For example, a service such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is categorized as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and, as such, requires the customer to perform all of the necessary security configuration and management tasks. Customers that deploy an Amazon EC2 instance are responsible for the management of the guest operating system (including updates and security patches), any application software or utilities installed by the customer on the instances, and the configuration of the AWS-provided firewall (called a security group) on each instance.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>For Amazon S3 service, managing the operating system and platform is customer responsibility</strong> - For abstracted services, such as Amazon S3, AWS operates the infrastructure layer, the operating system, and platforms, and customers access the endpoints to store and retrieve data. Customers are responsible for managing their data (including encryption options), classifying their assets, and using IAM tools to apply the appropriate permissions.</p>

<p><strong>AWS is responsible for patching and fixing flaws within the infrastructure, for patching the guest Operating Systems and applications of the customers</strong> - As part of Patch management, AWS is responsible for patching and fixing flaws within the infrastructure, but customers are responsible for patching their guest OS and applications.</p>

<p><strong>AWS is responsible for training their customers and their employees as part of Customer Specific training</strong> - As part of Awareness &amp; Training, AWS trains AWS employees, but a customer must train their own employees.</p>

<p><strong>CloudTrail logs</strong> - Elastic Load Balancing is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in Elastic Load Balancing. CloudTrail captures all API calls for Elastic Load Balancing as events. The calls captured include calls from the AWS Management Console and code calls to the Elastic Load Balancing API operations. If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for Elastic Load Balancing. If you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in Event history. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made to Elastic Load Balancing, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>CloudWatch metrics</strong> - You can use Amazon CloudWatch to retrieve statistics about data points for your load balancers and targets as an ordered set of time-series data, known as metrics. You can use these metrics to verify that your system is performing as expected.</p>

<p><strong>Load Balancer Access logs</strong> - You can use access logs to capture detailed information about the requests made to your load balancer and store them as log files in Amazon S3. You can use these access logs to analyze traffic patterns and to troubleshoot issues with your targets.</p>

<p><strong>Load Balancer Request tracing</strong> - You can use request tracing to track HTTP requests. The load balancer adds a header with a trace identifier to each request it receives.</p>

<p><strong>A security group or network ACL is not allowing traffic from the client</strong></p>

<p>If the load balancer is not responding to client requests, check for the following issues:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Your internet-facing load balancer may be attached to a private subnet - You must specify public subnets for your load balancer. A public subnet has a route to the Internet Gateway for your virtual private cloud (VPC).</p></li>
<li><p>A security group or network ACL does not allow traffic - The security group for the load balancer and any network ACLs for the load balancer subnets must allow inbound traffic from the clients and outbound traffic to the clients on the listener ports.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>It is an internal server error</strong> - HTTP 500 is the error code for internal server error, generated by Load Balancer and sent back to the requesting client. But, in the given use case, the client is unable to connect to the Load Balancer itself.</p>

<p><strong>The target returned the error code of 200 indicating an error on the server side</strong> - By default, the success code is 200. So, returning an HTTP 200 indicates a successful message.</p>

<p><strong>The target was incorrectly configured as a Lambda function and not an EC2 instance</strong> - An ELB can be configured to have a Lambda Function as its target. This should not result in any access issues or errors.</p>

<p><strong>Before you start using your Application Load Balancer, you must add one or more listeners</strong> - A listener checks for connection requests from clients, using the protocol and port that you configure. The rules that you define for a listener determine how the load balancer routes requests to its registered targets. Each rule consists of a priority, one or more actions, and one or more conditions. When the conditions for a rule are met, then its actions are performed. You must define a default rule for each listener, and you can optionally define additional rules.</p>

<p><strong>You configure target groups of an ALB by attaching them to the listeners</strong> - Each target group is used to route requests to one or more registered targets. When you create each listener rule, you specify a target group and conditions. When a rule condition is met, traffic is forwarded to the corresponding target group. You can create different target groups for different types of requests.</p>

via - <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html</a></p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>The targets of a target group in an ALB should all belong to the same Availability Zone</strong> - A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for clients. The load balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones. This increases the availability of your application.</p>

<p><strong>A target can be registered with only one target group at any given time</strong> - Each target group routes requests to one or more registered targets, such as EC2 instances, using the protocol and port number that you specify. You can register a target with multiple target groups.</p>

<p><strong>When you create a listener, you define actions and conditions for the default rule</strong> - When you create a listener, you define actions for the default rule. Default rules can't have conditions. If the conditions for none of a listener's rules are met, then the action for the default rule is performed.</p>

<p><strong>File Gateway of AWS Storage Gateway</strong> - AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that gives you on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage. Storage Gateway provides a standard set of storage protocols such as iSCSI, SMB, and NFS, which allow you to use AWS storage without rewriting your existing applications. It provides low-latency performance by caching frequently accessed data on-premises, while storing data securely and durably in Amazon cloud storage services. Storage Gateway optimizes data transfer to AWS by sending only changed data and compressing data.</p>

<p>File Gateway presents a file-based interface to Amazon S3, which appears as a network file share. It enables you to store and retrieve Amazon S3 objects through standard file storage protocols. File Gateway allows your existing file-based applications or devices to use secure and durable cloud storage without needing to be modified. With S3 File Gateway, your configured S3 buckets will be available as Network File System (NFS) mount points or Server Message Block (SMB) file shares. Your applications read and write files and directories over NFS or SMB, interfacing to the gateway as a file server. In turn, the gateway translates these file operations into object requests on your S3 buckets.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Volume Gateway of AWS Storage Gateway</strong> -  Volume Gateway provides an iSCSI target, which enables you to create block storage volumes and mount them as iSCSI devices from your on-premises or EC2 application servers. The Volume Gateway runs in either a cached or stored mode. Volume Gateway cannot be used for file storage.</p>

<p><strong>Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</strong> - Amazon S3 is object storage built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere. Amazon S3 provides a simple web service interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere. Using this service, you can easily build applications that make use of cloud-native storage. The given use case needs a hybrid storage facility since the data will be accessed from the on-premises servers and applications on AWS Cloud. Hence, S3 is not the right choice.</p>

<p><strong>Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)</strong> - Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is an easy-to-use, high-performance, block-storage service designed for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for both throughput and transaction-intensive workloads at any scale. A broad range of workloads, such as relational and non-relational databases, enterprise applications, containerized applications, big data analytics engines, file systems, and media workflows are widely deployed on Amazon EBS. The given use case needs a hybrid storage facility since the data will be accessed from the on-premises servers and applications on AWS Cloud. Hence, EBS is not the right choice.</p>

<p><strong>A delete marker is set on the deleted object, but the actual object is not deleted</strong> - A delete marker in Amazon S3 is a placeholder (or marker) for a versioned object that was named in a simple DELETE request. Because the object is in a versioning-enabled bucket, the object is not deleted. But the delete marker makes Amazon S3 behave as if it is deleted. A delete marker has a key name (or key) and version ID like any other object. It does not have data associated with it. It is not associated with an access control list (ACL) value.</p>

<p><strong>GET requests do not retrieve delete marker objects</strong> - The only way to list delete markers (and other versions of an object) is by using the versions subresource in a GET Bucket versions request. A simple GET does not retrieve delete marker objects.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Configure CloudFront that mandates viewers to use HTTPS to request objects from S3. Configure S3 bucket to support HTTPS communication only.

If your Amazon S3 bucket is configured as a website endpoint, you can't configure CloudFront to use HTTPS to communicate with your origin.</p>

<p>When your origin is an Amazon S3 bucket that supports HTTPS communication, CloudFront always forwards requests to S3 by using the protocol that viewers used to submit the requests.</p>

<p><strong>CloudFront always forwards requests to S3 by using the protocol that viewers used to submit the requests. So, we only need to configure CloudFront to mandate the use of HTTPS for users</strong> - This option has been added as a distractor. As mentioned earlier, if your Amazon S3 bucket is configured as a website endpoint, you can't configure CloudFront to use HTTPS while communicating with S3.</p>

<p><strong>A stack policy applies only during stack updates, it doesn't provide access controls. The developer needs to provide access through IAM policies</strong> - When you create a stack, all update actions are allowed on all resources. By default, anyone with stack update permissions can update all of the resources in the stack. You can prevent stack resources from being unintentionally updated or deleted during a stack update by using a stack policy. A stack policy is a JSON document that defines the update actions that can be performed on designated resources.</p>

<p>After you set a stack policy, all of the resources in the stack are protected by default. To allow updates on specific resources, you specify an explicit Allow statement for those resources in your stack policy. You can define only one stack policy per stack, but, you can protect multiple resources within a single policy.</p>

<p>A stack policy applies only during stack updates. It doesn't provide access controls like an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. Use a stack policy only as a fail-safe mechanism to prevent accidental updates to specific stack resources. To control access to AWS resources or actions, use IAM.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>The stack policy is invalid and hence the users are not granted any permissions. The developer needs to fix the syntactical errors in the policy</strong> - This statement is incorrect and given only as a distractor.</p>

<p><strong>Stack policies do not allow wildcard character value (<code>*</code>) for the <code>Principal</code> element of the policy</strong> - The Principal element specifies the entity that the policy applies to. This element is required while creating a policy but supports only the wildcard (*), which means that the policy applies to all principals.</p>

<p><strong>Stack policies are associated with a particular IAM role or an IAM user. Hence, they only work for the users you have explicitly attached the policy to</strong> - A stack policy applies to all AWS CloudFormation users who attempt to update the stack. You can't associate different stack policies with different users.</p>

<p><strong>The key policy for the CMK must give the external account (or users and roles in the external account) permission to use the CMK. IAM policies in the external account must delegate the key policy permissions to its users and roles</strong></p>

<p>You can allow IAM users or roles in one AWS account to use a customer master key (CMK) in a different AWS account. You can add these permissions when you create the CMK or change the permissions for an existing CMK.</p>

<p>To permit the usage of a CMK to users and roles in another account, you must use two different types of policies:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The key policy for the CMK must give the external account (or users and roles in the external account) permission to use the CMK. The key policy is in the account that owns the CMK.</p></li>
<li><p>IAM policies in the external account must delegate the key policy permissions to its users and roles. These policies are set in the external account and give permissions to users and roles in that account.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>AWS Owned CMK can be used across AWS accounts. Configure an AWS Owned CMK and use it across accounts that need to share the key material</strong> - AWS owned CMKs are a collection of CMKs that an AWS service owns and manages for use in multiple AWS accounts. However, you cannot view, use, track, or audit them</p>

<p><strong>Use AWS KMS service-linked roles to share access across AWS accounts</strong> - AWS Key Management Service uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service-linked roles. A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to AWS KMS. The service-linked roles are defined by AWS KMS and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf. You cannot use AWS KMS service-linked roles to share access across AWS accounts.</p>

<p><strong>Declare a key policy for the CMK to give the external account permission to use the CMK. This key policy should be embedded with the first request of every transaction</strong> - Key policy can not be directly shared across accounts.</p>

<p>AWS Backup is a fully managed and cost-effective backup service that simplifies and automates data backup across AWS services including Amazon EBS, Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon EFS, and AWS Storage Gateway. In addition, AWS Backup leverages AWS Organizations to implement and maintain a central view of backup policy across resources in a multi-account AWS environment. Customers simply tag and associate their AWS resources with backup policies managed by AWS Backup for Cross-Region data replication.</p>

<p>The following post shows how to centrally manage backup tasks across AWS accounts in your organization by deploying backup policies with AWS Backup.</p>

<p>Example AWS Backup Architecture:

<p>AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Windows let you define a schedule for when to perform potentially disruptive actions on your instances such as patching an operating system, updating drivers, or installing software or patches. Although a useful service, it is not suited for the given requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Use Amazon EventBridge to create a workflow for scheduled backup of all AWS resources under an account. Amazon S3 lifecycle policies, Amazon EC2 instance backups, and Amazon RDS backups can be used to create the events for the EventBridge. The same workflow can be scheduled to work on production and non-production environments, based on the tags created</strong> - Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus that makes it easy to connect applications together using data from your own applications, integrated Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services. It is possible to build a backup solution using EventBridge, but it will not be an optimized one, since AWS offers services with better features for centrally managing backups.</p>

<p><strong>Use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager to manage creation, deletion and managing of all the AWS resources under an account. Tag all the resources that need to be backed up and use lifecycle policies to customize the backup management to cater to the needs of the organization</strong> - DLM provides a simple way to manage the lifecycle of EBS resources, such as volume snapshots.

<p><strong>Use separate Amazon EBS volumes for the operating system and your data, even though root volume persistence feature is available</strong></p>

<p>As a best practice, AWS recommends the use of separate Amazon EBS volumes for the operating system and your data. This ensures that the volume with your data persists even after instance termination or any issues to the operating system.</p>

<p><strong>EBS snapshots only capture data that has been written to your Amazon EBS volume, which might exclude any data that has been locally cached by your application or operating system</strong></p>

<p>Snapshots only capture data that has been written to your Amazon EBS volume, which might exclude any data that has been locally cached by your application or OS. To ensure consistent snapshots on volumes attached to an instance, AWS recommends detaching the volume cleanly, issuing the snapshot command, and then reattaching the volume. For Amazon EBS volumes that serve as root devices, AWS recommends shutting down the machine to take a clean snapshot.</p>

<p><strong>By default, data on a non-root EBS volume is preserved even if the instance is shutdown or terminated</strong></p>

<p>By default, when you attach a non-root EBS volume to an instance, its DeleteOnTermination attribute is set to false. Therefore, the default is to preserve these volumes. After the instance terminates, you can take a snapshot of the preserved volume or attach it to another instance. You must delete a volume to avoid incurring further charges.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Data stored in the instance store is preserved when you stop or terminate your instance. However, data is lost when you hibernate the instance. Configure EBS volumes or have a backup plan to avoid using critical data to this behavior</strong> - Data stored in instance store is lost when you stop, hibernate or terminate the instance.</p>

<p><strong>EBS encryption does not support boot volumes</strong> - EBS volumes used as root devices can be encrypted without any issue.</p>

<p><strong>Snapshots of EBS volumes, stored on Amazon S3, can be accessed using Amazon S3 APIs</strong> - This is incorrect. Snapshots are only available through the Amazon EC2 API.</p>

<p><strong>The error indicates the IAM role is not correctly configured. After you've created a flow log, you cannot change its configuration. Instead, you need to delete the flow log and create a new one with the required configuration</strong></p>

<p>Access error can be caused by one of the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The IAM role for your flow log does not have sufficient permissions to publish flow log records to the CloudWatch log group</p></li>
<li><p>The IAM role does not have a trust relationship with the flow logs service</p></li>
<li><p>The trust relationship does not specify the flow logs service as the principal</p></li>
</ol>

<p>After you've created a flow log, you cannot change its configuration or the flow log record format. For example, you can't associate a different IAM role with the flow log or add or remove fields in the flow log record. Instead, you can delete the flow log and create a new one with the required configuration.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>The error indicates that the IAM role does not have a trust relationship with the flow logs service. Change the trust relationship from flow log configuration</strong> - As discussed above, the VPC flow log configuration cannot be changed once created.</p>

<p><strong>The flow log is still in the process of being created. It sometimes takes almost 10 minutes to start the logs</strong> - This scenario is possible when you have just configured the flow logs. However, the status of the flow logs will not be in an <code>error</code> state.</p>

<p><strong>The error indicates an internal error has occurred in the flow logs service. Raise a service request with AWS</strong> - This is a made-up option, given only as a distractor.</p>

<p><strong>The Security Groups of instances on VPC1 should be configured to allow inbound traffic from resources in VPC2. By default, Network ACLs allow all inbound and outbound traffic. So, a default Network ACLs on VPC1 will not need any configuration changes</strong> - A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic. Security groups act at the instance level, not the subnet level. Therefore, each instance in a subnet in your VPC can be assigned to a different set of security groups.</p>

<p>A network access control list (ACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.</p>

<p>Security groups are stateful — if you send a request from your instance, the response traffic for that request is allowed to flow in regardless of inbound security group rules. Responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to flow out, regardless of outbound rules.</p>

<p>Network ACLs are stateless, which means that responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to the rules for outbound traffic (and vice versa).</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Network ACLs and Security Groups share a parent-child relationship. If resources in VPC2 are given inbound and outbound permissions on Network ACLs of VPC1, the resources will get necessary permissions on the associated security groups too</strong> - This is an incorrect statement. Security Groups act at the instance level and Network ACLs are at the subnet level. They are different levels of security provided by AWS and do not form any hierarchy.</p>

<p><strong>By default, Security Groups allow outbound traffic. Hence, only the inbound traffic configuration of the security groups have to be changed to allow requests from resources in VPC2 to access instances in VPC1. If the subnet is not associated with any Network ACL, you will not need any configuration changes</strong> - Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a network ACL. If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a network ACL, the subnet is automatically associated with the default network ACL. Hence, a subnet will always have a network ACL associated with it.</p>

<p><strong>Based on the inbound and outbound traffic configurations on Network ACL of VPC1, you can create similar deny rules on Security Groups of the instances in VPC1 to deny all traffic, other than the one originating from resources in VPC2</strong> - Security Groups and Network ACLs are mutually exclusive and do not share permissions. Also, Security Groups can only be used to specify allow rules, and not deny rules.</p>

<p><strong>Enable Enhanced Monitoring for your RDS DB instance</strong> - Amazon RDS provides metrics in real time for the operating system (OS) that your DB instance runs on. You can view the metrics for your DB instance using the console. Also, you can consume the Enhanced Monitoring JSON output from Amazon CloudWatch Logs in a monitoring system of your choice.</p>

<p>By default, Enhanced Monitoring metrics are stored for 30 days in the CloudWatch Logs, which are different from typical CloudWatch metrics. Enhanced Monitoring for RDS provides the following OS metrics:
1.Free Memory
2.Active Memory
3.Swap Free
4.Processes Running
5.File System Used</p>

<p>You can use these metrics to understand the environment's performance, and these metrics are ingested by Amazon CloudWatch Logs as log entries. You can use CloudWatch to create alarms based on metrics. These alarms run actions, and you can publish these metrics from within your infrastructure, device, or application into CloudWatch as a custom metric. By using Enhanced Monitoring and CloudWatch together, you can automate tasks by creating a custom metric for the CloudWatch Logs RDS ingested date from the Enhanced Monitoring metrics. Enhanced Monitoring metrics are useful when you want to see how different processes or threads on a DB instance use the CPU.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Subscribe to Amazon RDS events to be notified when changes occur with a DB instance and its connected resources</strong> - Subscribe to Amazon RDS events to be notified when changes occur with a DB instance, DB snapshot, DB parameter group, or DB security group. Amazon RDS uses the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to provide notification when an Amazon RDS event occurs. This option is not relevant for the given use-case.</p>

<p><strong>Subscribe to CloudWatch metrics that track CPU utilization of the instances the RDS is hosted on</strong> - CloudWatch gathers metrics about CPU utilization from the hypervisor for a DB instance, and Enhanced Monitoring gathers its metrics from an agent on the instance. As a result, you might find differences between the measurements, because the hypervisor layer performs a small amount of work. The differences can be greater if your DB instances use smaller instance classes because then there are likely more virtual machines (VMs) that are managed by the hypervisor layer on a single physical instance. Enhanced Monitoring metrics are useful when you want to see how different processes or threads on a DB instance use the CPU.</p>

<p><strong>Enable Performance Insights to expand on the existing Amazon RDS monitoring features to illustrate your database's performance</strong> - Performance Insights collects metric data from the database engine to monitor the actual load on a database. Performance Insights will not help in gathering granular OS level metrics.</p>

<p>Since AWS Elastic Beanstalk performs an in-place update when you update your application versions, your application can become unavailable to users for a short period of time. You can avoid this downtime by performing a blue/green deployment, where you deploy the new version to a separate environment, and then swap CNAMEs of the two environments to redirect traffic to the new version instantly.</p>

<p>A blue/green deployment is also required when you want to update an environment to an incompatible platform version.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Use rolling with additional batch</strong> - With the rolling update, your application is deployed to your environment one batch of instances at a time. Most bandwidth is retained throughout the deployment. This also avoids downtime and minimizes reduced availability, at a cost of a longer deployment time. Since the use-case mandates a short deployment time, this option is ruled out.</p>

<p><strong>Upgrade the EC2 instance type</strong> - An upgraded instance type may only marginally improve the deployment time.</p>

<p><strong>Use all at once deployment pattern</strong> - With all at once deployment, Elastic Beanstalk deploys the new application version to each instance. Then, the web proxy or application server might need to restart. As a result, your application might be unavailable to users (or have low availability) for a short time. Since the use-case mandates high availability, this option is ruled out.</p>

<p><strong>You forgot the Wait Condition</strong></p>

<p>The cfn-init helper script reads template metadata from the AWS::CloudFormation::Init key and acts accordingly to:</p>

<p>Fetch and parse metadata from AWS CloudFormation</p>

<p>Install packages</p>

<p>Write files to disk</p>

<p>Enable/disable and start/stop services</p>

<p>The cfn-signal helper script signals AWS CloudFormation to indicate whether Amazon EC2 instances have been successfully created or updated. If you install and configure software applications on instances, you can signal AWS CloudFormation when those software applications are ready.</p>

<p>You can use the wait condition handle to make AWS CloudFormation pause the creation of a stack and wait for a signal before it continues to create the stack. For example, you might want to download and configure applications on an Amazon EC2 instance before considering the creation of that Amazon EC2 instance complete.</p>

<p>AWS CloudFormation creates a wait condition just like any other resource. When AWS CloudFormation creates a wait condition, it reports the wait condition’s status as CREATE_IN_PROGRESS and waits until it receives the requisite number of success signals or the wait condition’s timeout period has expired. If AWS CloudFormation receives the requisite number of success signals before the time out period expires, it continues creating the stack; otherwise, it sets the wait condition’s status to CREATE_FAILED and rolls the stack back.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>You did not disable Rollbacks</strong> - Enabling/disabling rollbacks has no impact on the ability to track the status of the cfn-init script.</p>

<p><strong>You forgot to include the cfn-signal command in your user data</strong> - This is a distractor as the cfn-signal command is managed via CloudFormation and not via the user data.</p>

<p><strong>You forgot to include a deletion policy</strong> - This is again a distractor as a deletion policy has nothing to do with tracking the status of the cfn-init script.</p>

<p><strong>Use DeletionPolicy=Snapshot</strong></p>

<p>To control how AWS CloudFormation handles the EBS volume when the stack is deleted, set a deletion policy for your volume. You can choose to retain the volume, to delete the volume, or to create a snapshot of the volume.</p>

<p>Here is the sample YAML:</p>

<pre><code>NewVolume:
  Type: AWS::EC2::Volume
  Properties:
    Size: 100
    Encrypted: true
    AvailabilityZone: !GetAtt Ec2Instance.AvailabilityZone
    Tags:
      - Key: MyTag
        Value: TagValue
  DeletionPolicy: Snapshot
</code></pre>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Enable termination protection</strong> - You can prevent a stack from being accidentally deleted by enabling termination protection on the stack. If a user attempts to delete a stack with termination protection enabled, the deletion fails and the stack--including its status--remains unchanged. You can enable termination protection on a stack when you create it. Termination protection on stacks is disabled by default. You can set termination protection on a stack with any status except DELETE_IN_PROGRESS or DELETE_COMPLETE.</p>

<p><strong>Use cfn helper scripts and Wait Conditions upon stack deletion</strong> - The cfn helper scripts such as cfn-init, cfn-signal, etc help in installing packages or to indicate whether Amazon EC2 instances have been successfully created or updated. You cannot use these scripts to mandatorily keep a snapshot of the EBS volume.</p>

<p><strong>Reference the EBS volume as a stack output</strong> - The optional Outputs section for a CloudFormation stack declares output values that you can import into other stacks (to create cross-stack references), return in response (to describe stack calls), or view on the AWS CloudFormation console. You should note that a stack that is referenced by another stack cannot be deleted and it cannot modify or remove the exported value. Just by referencing the EBS volume as a stack output, you will not be able to enforce the snapshot of the EBS volume.</p>

<p><strong>The subnet where the application is deployed does not have a network route to the CloudFormation service through a NAT Gateway or Internet Gateway</strong> - As the use-case mentions an internal full LAMP stack, this implies that the stack is to be deployed in a private subnet. Now this private subnet must have a network route to the CloudFormation service through a NAT Gateway or Internet Gateway.</p>

<p>You can use a network address translation (NAT) gateway to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevent the internet from initiating a connection with those instances.</p>

<p>An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet. It, therefore, imposes no availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic. Internet Gateways must be deployed in a public subnet and the corresponding entry should be added in the route table.</p>

<p><strong>The cfn-signal script does not get executed before the timeout of the wait condition</strong></p>

<p>The Timeout property determines how long AWS CloudFormation waits for the requisite number of success signals. Timeout is a minimum-bound property, meaning the timeout occurs no sooner than the time you specify, but can occur shortly thereafter. The maximum time that you can specify is 43200 seconds (12 hours ). For the given scenario, the stack creation can fail as CloudFormation may fail to receive a signal from your EC2 instance if the Timeout property is set to a low value.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>The EC2 instance does not have a proper IAM role allowing to signal the success to CloudFormation</strong> - You do not need an IAM role to use cfn-signal.</p>

<p><strong>AWS is experiencing an Insufficient Capacity for the instance type you requested</strong> - In case of Insufficient Capacity, the instance would have not been created and the CloudFormation stack would have failed altogether.</p>

<p><strong>The cfn-init script failed</strong> - The cfn-init script failure should still be followed by the cfn-signal script, which would have sent a signal to CloudFormation nonetheless.</p>

<p><strong>Set OnFailure=DO_NOTHING</strong></p>

<p>You can use the OnFailure property of the CloudFormation CreateStack call for this use-case. The OnFailure property determines what action will be taken if stack creation fails. This must be one of DO_NOTHING, ROLLBACK, or DELETE. You can specify either OnFailure or DisableRollback, but not both.</p>

<p>Using the OnFailure property, you can prevent the termination of the EC2 instances created by the CloudFormation stack.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Install the CloudWatch logs agent, create a new IAM role and assign it to the EC2 instance, and send the logs directly to CloudWatch Logs</strong></p>

<p><strong>Enable VPC Flow Logs and intercept the cfn-init log file</strong></p>

<p>As the use-case mentions that there should be no changes done to the EC2 instance, so both these options are ruled out since these involve installing or configuring additional software.</p>

<p><strong>Increase the Wait Timeout to 2 hours</strong> - The wait timeout works with cfn-signal, however, the given issue is related to cfn-init wherein some underlying code is failing. Therefore increasing wait timeout is not a valid solution for this scenario.</p>

<p><strong>Create two 4 TB gp2 drives and mount them in RAID 0 on the EC2 instance</strong></p>

<p>With Amazon EBS, you can use any of the standard RAID configurations that you can use with a traditional bare metal server, as long as that particular RAID configuration is supported by the operating system for your instance. This is because all RAID is accomplished at the software level.</p>

<p>For greater I/O performance than you can achieve with a single volume, RAID 0 can stripe multiple volumes together; for on-instance redundancy, RAID 1 can mirror two volumes together. So for the given use-case, to increase the performance, you should use RAID 0.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Convert the gp2 drive to io1 and increase the PIOPS</strong> - Changing the gp2 drive to io1 entails more costs as the pricing is $0.10 per GB-month of provisioned storage for gp2 and $0.125 per GB-month of provisioned storage for io1. So this option is ruled out.</p>

<p><strong>Create two 4 TB gp2 drives and mount them in RAID 1 on the EC2 instance</strong> - You should use RAID 1 when fault tolerance is more important than I/O performance.</p>

<p><strong>Enable burst mode on the gp2 drive</strong> - gp2 volumes can burst to 3,000 IOPS for extended periods of time. This option is a distractor as you do not need to enable the burst mode for gp2 volumes as it's available by default.</p>

<p><strong>S3</strong></p>

<p>Amazon S3 default encryption provides a way to set the default encryption behavior for an S3 bucket. You can set default encryption on a bucket so that all new objects are encrypted when they are stored in the bucket. The objects are encrypted using server-side encryption with either Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). When you use server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts an object before saving it to disk and decrypts it when you download the objects.</p>

<p>There is no change to the encryption of the objects that existed in the bucket before default encryption was enabled.</p>

<p>So for the given use-case, you can continue to use the same S3 buckets without impacting operations.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>RDS</strong> - You can only enable encryption for an Amazon RDS DB instance when you create it, not after the DB instance is created.</p>

<p>However, because you can encrypt a copy of an unencrypted snapshot, you can effectively add encryption to an unencrypted DB instance. That is, you can create a snapshot of your DB instance, and then create an encrypted copy of that snapshot. You can then restore a DB instance from the encrypted snapshot, and thus you have an encrypted copy of your original DB instance.</p>

<p><strong>EBS</strong> - There is no direct way to encrypt an existing unencrypted volume or snapshot, you can encrypt them by creating either a volume or a snapshot. If you enabled encryption by default, Amazon EBS encrypts the resulting new volume or snapshot using your default key for EBS encryption.</p>

<p><strong>EFS</strong> - You can enable encryption of data at rest when creating an Amazon EFS file system. Once the file system is created, you cannot modify the file system to be unencrypted or vice-versa.</p>

<p><strong>S3 versioning is enabled and delete markers are still present in the bucket</strong></p>

<p>S3 Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. You can use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your Amazon S3 bucket. With versioning, you can easily recover from both unintended user actions and application failures. When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all of the objects.</p>

<p>If you overwrite an object, it results in a new object version in the bucket. You can always restore the previous version.</p>

<p>If you delete an object, instead of removing it permanently, Amazon S3 inserts a delete marker, which becomes the current object version.</p>

<p>So for the given use-case, as delete markers are still present in the bucket, therefore you get the error saying the bucket is not empty.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>S3 is eventually consistent. Wait two minutes and retry, it will work then</strong> - This is a made-up option. Amazon S3 provides strong read-after-write consistency for PUTs and DELETEs of objects in your Amazon S3 bucket in all AWS Regions.</p>

<p><strong>An S3 bucket policy is set up and it prevents bucket deletion</strong> - You could set up a bucket policy to prevent bucket deletion, but it would not present an error that says the bucket is not empty.</p>

<p><strong>Some files are in Glacier</strong> - You store your data in Amazon S3 Glacier as archives. Archives may be further grouped into vaults. So files are not stored in buckets for Glacier. So while deleting, you will not get an error that says the bucket is not empty.</p>

<p><strong>Suspending versioning</strong></p>

<p>You may add another layer of security by configuring a bucket to enable MFA (multi-factor authentication) Delete, which requires additional authentication for either of the following operations:</p>

<p>Change the versioning state of your bucket</p>

<p>Permanently delete an object version</p>

<p>MFA Delete requires two forms of authentication together:</p>

<p>Your security credentials</p>

<p>The concatenation of a valid serial number, a space, and the six-digit code displayed on an approved authentication device</p>

<p>If a bucket's versioning configuration is MFA Delete–enabled, the bucket owner must include the x-amz-mfa request header in requests to permanently delete an object version or change the versioning state of the bucket. Requests that include x-amz-mfa must use HTTPS.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Enabling Versioning</strong> - You do not need MFA to enable versioning for a bucket.</p>

<p><strong>Enable S3 Access Logs and analyze them using Athena</strong></p>

<p>By default, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) doesn't collect server access logs. When you enable logging, Amazon S3 delivers access logs for a source bucket to a target bucket that you choose. The target bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the source bucket and must not have a default retention period configuration.</p>

<p>Server access logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to an S3 bucket. Server access logs are useful for many applications. For example, access log information can be useful in security and access audits. It can also help you learn about your customer base and understand your Amazon S3 bill. Each access log record provides details about a single access request, such as the requester, bucket name, request time, request action, response status, and an error code, if relevant.</p>

<p>Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to set up or manage, and customers pay only for the queries they run. You can use Athena to process logs, perform ad-hoc analysis, and run interactive queries.</p>

<p>For the given use-case, you can enable S3 access logs and then use Athena to analyze the access patterns for specific employees.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Restrict their IAM policies and look at CloudTrail logs</strong> - Restricting their IAM policies would deny access to S3 which is to be avoided per the use-case.</p>

<p><strong>Use a bucket policy</strong> - You cannot use a bucket policy to log S3 access information</p>

<p><strong>Use AWS Config to define compliance rules on these users</strong> - AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. With Config, you can review changes in configurations and relationships between AWS resources, dive into detailed resource configuration histories, and determine your overall compliance against the configurations specified in your internal guidelines. You can use Config to answer questions such as - "What did my AWS resource look like at xyz point in time?". You cannot use AWS Config to log S3 access information.</p>

<p><strong>Generate pre-signed URLs for your reports</strong></p>

<p>A presigned URL gives you access to the object identified in the URL, provided that the creator of the presigned URL has permissions to access that object.</p>

<p>All objects by default are private. Only the object owner has permission to access these objects. However, the object owner can optionally share objects with others by creating a presigned URL, using their own security credentials, to grant time-limited permission to download the objects.</p>

<p>When you create a presigned URL for your object, you must provide your security credentials, specify a bucket name, an object key, specify the HTTP method (GET to download the object) and expiration date and time. The presigned URLs are valid only for the specified duration.</p>

<p>Anyone who receives the presigned URL can then access the object. For example, if you have a video in your bucket and both the bucket and the object are private, you can share the video with others by generating a presigned URL.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Provide each of your customers an AWS user and tell them to use the CLI</strong> - This is not practicable considering that there are 10,000 customers.</p>

<p><strong>Create a bucket policy so that the S3 files are only accessible from CloudFront and force SSL mutual authentication there</strong> - Mutual Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication is supported for Amazon API Gateway and not for CloudFront. This is a new method for client-to-server authentication that can be used with API Gateway’s existing authorization options.</p>

<p><strong>Make the S3 bucket public and password protect each S3 file. Share the password with each customer</strong> - This is a distractor as there is no way to password protect files on S3.</p>

<p><strong>Using an Origin Access Identity and a bucket policy</strong></p>

<p>To restrict access to content that you serve from Amazon S3 buckets, you need to follow these steps:</p>

<p>Create a special CloudFront user called an origin access identity (OAI) and associate it with your distribution.</p>

<p>Configure your S3 bucket permissions so that CloudFront can use the OAI to access the files in your bucket and serve them to your users. Make sure that users can’t use a direct URL to the S3 bucket to access a file there.</p>

<p>After you take these steps, users can only access your files through CloudFront, not directly from the S3 bucket.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Attaching an IAM role to CloudFront and defining a bucket policy to only allow this role</strong> - This is a distractor as you cannot associate an IAM role to CloudFront.</p>

<p><strong>Encrypt all your files using a KMS key that only CloudFront can access</strong> - Although you could enable SSE-KMS on S3 and serve content using CloudFront by using Lambda@Edge, but this solution does not address the given use-case. You can ensure that only CloudFront is allowed to access the S3 bucket files by using Origin Access Identity and a bucket policy.</p>

<p><strong>Store the files in S3 and distribute them using a CloudFront distribution instead</strong></p>

<p>S3 is more cost-effective than EFS. For example, per GB storage cost for S3 is $0.023/month whereas per GB storage cost for EFS is $0.3/month. Further, storing your static content with S3 provides a lot of advantages. But to help optimize your application’s performance and security while effectively managing cost, AWS recommends that you also set up Amazon CloudFront to work with your S3 bucket to serve and protect the content. CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that delivers static and dynamic web content, video streams, and APIs around the world, securely and at scale. By design, delivering data out of CloudFront can be more cost-effective than delivering it from S3 directly to your users.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Enable static file caching on the ALB</strong> - This is a distractor as there is no such thing as static file caching on the ALB.</p>

<p><strong>Store the files on instance stores instead, so you don't need to use EFS anymore</strong> - You cannot use Instance Stores since they are physically attached to their own EC2 instances. Instance Store is not a shared storage like EFS, so this option is ruled out.</p>

<p><strong>Enable enhanced networking between EC2 and ALB</strong> - Enhanced networking uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide high-performance networking capabilities on supported EC2 instance types. SR-IOV is a method of device virtualization that provides higher I/O performance and lower CPU utilization when compared to traditional virtualized network interfaces. There is no such thing as enhanced networking between EC2 and ALB.</p>

<p><strong>Analyze the CloudFront access logs using Athena</strong></p>

<p>You can configure CloudFront to create log files that contain detailed information about every user request that CloudFront receives. These are called standard logs, also known as access logs. These standard logs are available for both web and RTMP distributions. If you enable standard logs, you can also specify the Amazon S3 bucket that you want CloudFront to save files in.</p>

<p><img src="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/images/Logging.png">
via - <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html</a></p>

<p>AWS recommends that you use the logs to understand the nature of the requests for your content, not as a complete accounting of all requests. CloudFront delivers access logs on a best-effort basis. The log entry for a particular request might be delivered long after the request was actually processed and, in rare cases, a log entry might not be delivered at all. When a log entry is omitted from access logs, the number of entries in the access logs won't match the usage that appears in the AWS usage and billing reports.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Analyze the CloudFront access logs using Inspector</strong></p>

<p><strong>Enable S3 access logs and analyze using Inspector</strong></p>

<p>Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps you test the network accessibility of your Amazon EC2 instances and the security state of your applications running on the instances.</p>

<p>Inspector cannot be used to analyze CloudFront access logs or S3 access logs, so both these options are incorrect.</p>

<p><strong>Enable S3 access logs and analyze using Athena</strong> - The S3 access logs will not provide details about the user IP and other crucial information, as the requests are proxied through CloudFront. Additionally, results are cached in CloudFront and the S3 access logs won't contain a lot of information, so this option is incorrect.</p>

<p><strong>Store the archives in Glacier and set up a Vault Lock Policy for WORM access</strong></p>

<p>You store your data in Amazon S3 Glacier as archives. Archives may be further grouped into vaults.</p>

<p>S3 Glacier Vault Lock allows you to easily deploy and enforce compliance controls for individual S3 Glacier vaults with a vault lock policy. You can specify controls such as “write once read many” (WORM) in a vault lock policy and lock the policy from future edits. Once locked, the policy can no longer be changed.</p>

<p>For the given use-case, as you need to ensure that the archives are not tampered, so you need to store the archives in Glacier and set up a Vault Lock Policy for WORM access.</p>

MFA-Delete would only protect against permanent delete of any object.</p>

<p><strong>Store the archives in EBS and use Linux file system protection on the files</strong> Linux file system protection would not be able to enforce compliance controls for the archives in EFS.</p>

<p><strong>Store the archives in AWS Artifact and enable compliance monitoring</strong> - AWS Artifact is a self-service audit artifact retrieval portal that provides our customers with on-demand access to AWS’ compliance documentation and AWS agreements.

<p><strong>Use Snowball Edge</strong></p>

<p>AWS Snowball, a part of the AWS Snow Family, is a data migration and edge computing device that comes in two options. Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices provide both block storage and Amazon S3-compatible object storage, and 40 vCPUs. They are well suited for local storage and large scale data transfer. Snowball Edge Compute Optimized devices provide 52 vCPUs, block and object storage, and an optional GPU for use cases like advanced machine learning and full-motion video analysis in disconnected environments.</p>

<p>Snowball Edge Storage Optimized is the optimal choice if you need to securely and quickly transfer dozens of terabytes to petabytes of data to AWS. It provides up to 80 TB of usable HDD storage, 40 vCPUs, 1 TB of SATA SSD storage, and up to 40 Gb network connectivity to address large scale data transfer and pre-processing use cases.</p>

<p>For the given use-case, you can use multiple Snowball Edge devices to migrate the entire data to AWS Cloud.</p>

<p>Exam Alert:</p>

<p>The original Snowball devices were transitioned out of service and Snowball Edge Storage Optimized are now the primary devices used for data transfer. You may see the Snowball device on the exam, just remember that the original Snowball device had 80TB of storage space.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Use S3 transfer acceleration</strong> - Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration can speed up content transfers to and from Amazon S3 by as much as 50-500% for long-distance transfer of larger objects. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path. As the data center does not have sufficient bandwidth infrastructure, so this option is ruled out.</p>

<p><strong>Use Volume Gateway</strong> - You can configure the AWS Storage Gateway service as a Volume Gateway to present cloud-based iSCSI block storage volumes to your on-premises applications. The Volume Gateway provides either a local cache or full volumes on-premises while also storing full copies of your volumes in the AWS cloud. Volume Gateway also provides Amazon EBS Snapshots of your data for backup, disaster recovery, and migration. It's easy to get started with the Volume Gateway: Deploy it as a virtual machine or hardware appliance, give it local disk resources, connect it to your applications, and start using your hybrid cloud storage for block data. As the data center does not have sufficient bandwidth infrastructure, so this option is ruled out.</p>

<p><strong>Use AWS Data Migration</strong> - AWS Database Migration Service helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely. The source database remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing downtime to applications that rely on the database. The AWS Database Migration Service can migrate your data to and from the most widely used commercial and open-source databases. As the data center does not have sufficient bandwidth infrastructure, so this option is ruled out.</p>

<p><strong>Tape Gateway</strong></p>

<p>Tape Gateway enables you to replace using physical tapes on-premises with virtual tapes in AWS without changing existing backup workflows. Tape Gateway supports all leading backup applications and caches virtual tapes on-premises for low-latency data access. Tape Gateway encrypts data between the gateway and AWS for secure data transfer and compresses data and transitions virtual tapes between Amazon S3 and Amazon S3 Glacier, or Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive, to minimize storage costs.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>File Gateway</strong> - File Gateway provides a seamless way to connect to the cloud in order to store application data files and backup images as durable objects in Amazon S3 cloud storage. File Gateway offers SMB or NFS-based access to data in Amazon S3 with local caching. It can be used for on-premises applications, and for Amazon EC2-based applications that need file protocol access to S3 object storage.</p>

<p>File Gateway cannot be used to facilitate tape backup processes.</p>

<p><strong>Volume Gateway</strong> - You can configure the AWS Storage Gateway service as a Volume Gateway to present cloud-based iSCSI block storage volumes to your on-premises applications.

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>EFS</strong> - Amazon EFS is a file storage service for use with Amazon EC2. Amazon EFS provides a file system interface, file system access semantics (such as strong consistency and file locking), and concurrently-accessible storage for up to thousands of Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon S3 is an object storage service. EFS cannot leverage S3 for storage.</p>

<p><strong>EBS Drives</strong> - Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is an easy to use, high-performance, block-storage service designed for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for both throughput and transaction-intensive workloads at any scale. A broad range of workloads, such as relational and non-relational databases, enterprise applications, containerized applications, big data analytics engines, file systems, and media workflows are widely deployed on Amazon EBS. EBS cannot leverage S3 for storage.</p>

<p><strong>Volume Gateway</strong> - You can configure the AWS Storage Gateway service as a Volume Gateway to present cloud-based iSCSI block storage volumes to your on-premises applications. The Volume Gateway provides either a local cache or full volumes on-premises while also storing full copies of your volumes in the AWS cloud.

It's easy to get started with the Volume Gateway: Deploy it as a virtual machine or hardware appliance, give it local disk resources, connect it to your applications, and start using your hybrid cloud storage for block data. Since Volume Gateway represents cloud-backed iSCSI block storage, so it cannot be used to replace an on-premise NFS v3 drive, so this option is incorrect.</p>

<p><strong>Federate the users with Cognito so they can assume a role to access S3</strong></p>

<p>Amazon Cognito lets you add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily. Amazon Cognito scales to millions of users and supports sign-in with social identity providers, such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon, and enterprise identity providers via SAML 2.0. Application-specific user authentication can be provided via a Cognito User Pool and then users can access AWS services such as S3 using a Cognito Identity Pool. Here Cognito is the best technology choice for managing mobile user accounts.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Create an AWS Lambda function that will create an IAM User for each new user, and store their API keys in the mobile app database</strong> - Creating an IAM user for each new user of the mobile phone is not practicable, so this option is ruled out.</p>

<p><strong>Create one IAM user and publish the access keys as part of the mobile application</strong> - This is a security bad-practice. You should not expose the IAM user access keys via a third-party application. The best solution is to use Cognito user pool for authentication and then access AWS services using an identity pool.</p>

<p><strong>Federate the users with SAML so they can use Single Sign-On (SSO) to access S3</strong> - The scenario does not mention that the users belong to a specific organization, therefore you cannot use SAML to facilitate SSO to access S3.</p>

<p><strong>DB Security Group inbound rules have changed</strong></p>

<p>A security group acts as a virtual firewall that controls the traffic for one or more instances. When you launch an instance, you can specify one or more security groups; otherwise, we use the default security group. You can add rules to each security group that allows traffic to or from its associated instances. You can modify the rules for a security group at any time; the new rules are automatically applied to all instances that are associated with the security group. When we decide whether to allow traffic to reach an instance, we evaluate all the rules from all the security groups that are associated with the instance.</p>

<p>The following are the characteristics of security group rules:</p>

<p>By default, security groups allow all outbound traffic.</p>

<p>Security group rules are always permissive; you can't create rules that deny access.</p>

<p>Security groups are stateful</p>

<p>For the given use-case, if the DB Security Group inbound rules have changed, then the website may not be able to connect to the database.</p>

<p><strong>Network ACL inbound rules have changed</strong></p>

<p><strong>Network ACL outbound rules have changed</strong></p>

<p>A network access control list (ACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.</p>

<p>The following are the basic things that you need to know about network ACLs:</p>

<p>The default NACL allows all inbound and outbound IPv4 traffic and, if applicable, IPv6 traffic.</p>

<p>You can create a custom network ACL and associate it with a subnet. By default, each custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules.</p>

<p>Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a network ACL. If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a network ACL, the subnet is automatically associated with the default network ACL.</p>

<p>You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets. However, a subnet can be associated with only one network ACL at a time. When you associate a network ACL with a subnet, the previous association is removed.</p>

<p>A network ACL contains a numbered list of rules. AWS evaluates the rules in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule, to determine whether traffic is allowed in or out of any subnet associated with the network ACL. The highest number that you can use for a rule is 32766. AWS recommends that you start by creating rules in increments (for example, increments of 10 or 100) so that you can insert new rules where you need to later on.</p>

<p>A network ACL has separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can either allow or deny traffic.</p>

<p>Network ACLs are stateless, which means that responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to the rules for outbound traffic (and vice versa).</p>

<p>For the given use-case, if the inbound or the outbound NACL rules have changed, then the website may not be able to connect to the database.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Security Group outbound rules have changed</strong> - Since security groups are stateful so incoming connections can send a reply back to, regardless of any outbound rules, so this option is incorrect.</p>

<p><strong>The primary database's private IP has changed</strong> - The private IP associated with an RDS database can change due to things such as multi-AZ failover, so you should use the DNS endpoint to connect to the database. Even if the private IP of the database changes, the DNS endpoint would not change on its own. So this option is incorrect.</p>

<p><strong>A read replica has been created recently</strong> - Adding a read replica does not change the primary database's DNS name, so this option is ruled out.</p>

<p><strong>Create an RDS Read Replica for the ETL team</strong></p>

<p>Amazon RDS Read Replicas provide enhanced performance and durability for RDS database (DB) instances. They make it easy to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads. For the MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server database engines, Amazon RDS creates a second DB instance using a snapshot of the source DB instance. It then uses the engines' native asynchronous replication to update the read replica whenever there is a change to the source DB instance.</p>

<p>For the given use-case, you can use one or more read replicas for the given source DB instance as the source for the ETL process to populate the data lake on S3.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Enable RDS Multi-AZ</strong> - Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for RDS database (DB) instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). You cannot use Multi-AZ to improve the ETL process as it cannot use the standby instance as a source for the ETL process.</p>

<p>Exam Alert:</p>

<p>Please review the key differences between Read Replicas and Multi-AZ:

<p><strong>Upgrade the RDS instance type</strong> - Upgrade the RDS instance type may help a little bit, but the problem will resurface as traffic increases further. A better solution is to use the Read Replica as the source for the ETL process to populate the data lake on S3.</p>

<p><strong>Use Athena to query RDS</strong> - Although Athena can query data from RDS by using its federated query feature, however, the problem would persist as the entire ETL load will fall on the main database. A better solution is to use the Read Replica as the source for the ETL process to populate the data lake on S3.</p>

<p><strong>Enable RDS Multi-AZ</strong></p>

<p>RDS provides high availability and failover support for DB instances using Multi-AZ deployments. In a Multi-AZ deployment, RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone.</p>

<p>The failover happens only in the following conditions:</p>

<p>The primary DB instance fails</p>

<p>An Availability Zone outage</p>

<p>The DB instance server type is changed</p>

<p>The operating system of the DB instance is undergoing software patching.</p>

<p>A manual failover of the DB instance can be initiated using Reboot with failover.</p>

<p><strong>Create an RDS read replica in a different region and an AWS lambda function to promote that replica as the main database when the main RDS database is down</strong></p>

<p>RDS Read Replicas provide enhanced performance and durability for RDS database (DB) instances. They make it easy to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads. Whether you create the Read Replica in the same AWS Region or a different Region from the primary DB, you cannot use it for building a High Availability solution that also transparently switches to the standby by maintaining the same DB endpoint. Using AWS Lambda to promote the Read Replica as the main database when the primary RDS database is down, would cause the DB endpoint to change.</p>

<p>Therefore, both of these options are incorrect.</p>

<p>Exam Alert:</p>

<p><strong>Setup a CloudWatch alarm for DB RAM going over 90% and reboot the database then</strong> - This is akin to applying a band-aid. As the root cause persists, as soon as the DB instance is up and running, you will face the DB performance issues again.</p>

<p><strong>Resizing of an instance is only possible if the root device for your instance is an EBS volume</strong> - If the root device for your instance is an EBS volume, you can change the size of the instance simply by changing its instance type, which is known as resizing it. If the root device for your instance is an instance store volume, you must migrate your application to a new instance with the instance type that you need.</p>

<p><strong>You must stop your Amazon EBS–backed instance before you can change its instance type. AWS moves the instance to new hardware; however, the instance ID does not change</strong> - You must stop your Amazon EBS–backed instance before you can change its instance type. When you stop and start an instance, AWS moves the instance to new hardware; however, the instance ID does not change.</p>

<p><strong>If your instance is in an Auto Scaling group, the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service marks the stopped instance as unhealthy, and may terminate it and launch a replacement instance</strong> - If your instance is in an Auto Scaling group, the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service marks the stopped instance as unhealthy, and may terminate it and launch a replacement instance. To prevent this, you can suspend the scaling processes for the group while you're resizing your instance.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>The new instance retains its public, private IPv4 addresses, any Elastic IP addresses, and any IPv6 addresses that were associated with the old instance</strong> - If your instance has a public IPv4 address, AWS releases the address and gives it a new public IPv4 address. The instance retains its private IPv4 addresses, any Elastic IP addresses, and any IPv6 addresses.</p>

<p><strong>There is no downtime on the instance if you choose an instance of a compatible type since AWS starts the new instance and shifts the applications from current instance</strong> - AWS suggests that you plan for downtime while your instance is stopped. Stopping and resizing an instance may take a few minutes, and restarting your instance may take a variable amount of time depending on your application's startup scripts.</p>

<p><strong>Resizing of an instance is possible if the root device is either EBS volume or an instance store volume. However, instance store volumes taking longer to start on the new instance, since cache data is lost on these instances</strong> - As discussed above, resizing of an instance is possible only if the root device for the instance is an EBS volume.</p>

<p><strong>Application Load balancers do not send data to X-Ray</strong> - Elastic Load Balancing application load balancers add a trace ID to incoming HTTP requests in a header named X-Amzn-Trace-Id. Load balancers do not send data to X-Ray and do not appear as a node on your service map.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>AWS X-Ray does not integrate with Amazon S3 and you need to use CloudTrail for tracking requests on S3</strong> - AWS X-Ray integrates with Amazon S3 to trace upstream requests to update your application's S3 buckets.</p>

<p><strong>AWS X-Ray cannot be used to trace your AWS Lambda functions since they are not integrated</strong> - You can use AWS X-Ray to trace your AWS Lambda functions. Lambda runs the X-Ray daemon and records a segment with details about the function invocation and execution.</p>

<p><strong>You cannot use X-Ray to trace or analyze user requests to your Amazon API Gateway APIs</strong> - You can use X-Ray to trace and analyze user requests as they travel through your Amazon API Gateway APIs to the underlying services. API Gateway supports X-Ray tracing for all API Gateway endpoint types: Regional, edge-optimized, and private. You can use X-Ray with Amazon API Gateway in all AWS Regions where X-Ray is available.</p>

<p><strong>If your AMI contains a CloudWatch agent, it’s automatically installed on EC2 instances when you create an EC2 Auto Scaling group. The developer needs to choose the AMI that has CloudWatch agent pre-configured on it</strong></p>

<p>If your AMI contains a CloudWatch agent, it’s automatically installed on EC2 instances when you create an EC2 Auto Scaling group. With the stock Amazon Linux AMI, you need to install it (AWS recommends to install via yum).</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>CloudWatch agent can be configured to be loaded on the EC2 instances while configuring the ASG. The developer could have unintentionally checked this flag on one of the ASGs he created</strong> - This is incorrect and added only as a distractor.</p>

<p><strong>The architecture of the <code>InstanceType</code> mentioned in your launch configuration does not match the image architecture.

<p><strong>The instance architecture might not have been compatible with the AMI chosen. The incompatibility results in various errors, one of which is, some of the AWS services will not be installed as expected</strong> - If there are compatibility issues, the ASG will not be able to spin up instances, and throws an error that explains the compatibility error.</p>

<p><strong>You can bring an existing resource into AWS CloudFormation management using <code>resource import</code></strong></p>

<p>If you created an AWS resource outside of AWS CloudFormation management, you can bring this existing resource into AWS CloudFormation management using <code>resource import</code>. You can manage your resources using AWS CloudFormation regardless of where they were created without having to delete and re-create them as part of a stack.</p>

<p>During an import operation, you create a change set that imports your existing resources into a stack or creates a new stack from your existing resources. You provide the following during import.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A template that describes the entire stack, including both the original stack resources and the resources you're importing. Each resource to import must have a DeletionPolicy attribute.</p></li>
<li><p>Identifiers for the resources to import. You provide two values to identify each target resource.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>a) An identifier property. This is a resource property that can be used to identify each resource type. For example, an AWS::S3::Bucket resource can be identified using its BucketName.</p>

<p>b) An identifier value. This is the target resource's actual property value. For example, the actual value for the BucketName property might be MyS3Bucket.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Use <code>Parameters</code> section of CloudFormation template to input the required resources</strong> - Parameters are a way to provide inputs to your AWS CloudFormation template. They are useful when you want to reuse your templates. Some inputs can not be determined ahead of time. They aren't useful for importing resources into CloudFormation.</p>

<p><strong>You can use <code>Mappings</code> part of CloudFormation template to input the needed resources</strong> - Mappings are fixed variables within your CloudFormation Template. They’re very handy to differentiate between different environments (dev vs prod), regions (AWS regions), AMI types, etc. They aren't useful for importing resources into CloudFormation.</p>

<p><strong>Drift detection is the mechanism by which you add resources to the stack of Cloudformation resources already created</strong> - Performing a drift detection operation on a stack determines whether the stack has drifted from its expected template configuration, and returns detailed information about the drift status of each resource in the stack that supports drift detection. It is not useful for importing resources into CloudFormation.</p>

<p><strong>To support throughput near or exceeding 20K packets per second (PPS) on the VIF driver</strong> - Enhanced networking uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide high-performance networking capabilities on supported instance types. SR-IOV is a method of device virtualization that provides higher I/O performance and lower CPU utilization when compared to traditional virtualized network interfaces. Enhanced networking provides higher bandwidth, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, and consistently lower inter-instance latencies. There is no additional charge for using enhanced networking.</p>

<p>Consider using enhanced networking for the following scenarios:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If your packets-per-second rate reaches its ceiling, consider moving to enhanced networking. If your rate reaches its ceiling, you've likely reached the upper thresholds of the virtual network interface driver.</p></li>
<li><p>If your throughput is near or exceeding 20K packets per second (PPS) on the VIF driver, it's a best practice to use enhanced networking.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>All current generation instance types support enhanced networking, except for T2 instances.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>To reach speeds up to 2,500 Gbps between EC2 instances</strong> - If you need to reach speeds up to 25 Gbps between instances, launch instances in a cluster placement group along with ENA compatible instances. If you need to reach speeds up to 10 Gbps between instances, launch your instances into a cluster placement group with the enhanced networking instance type. This option has been added as a distractor, as it is not possible to support speeds up to 2,500 Gbps between EC2 instances.</p>

<p><strong>To configure multi-attach for an EBS volume that can be attached to a maximum of 16 EC2 instances in a single Availability Zone</strong> - An EBS (io1 or io2) volume, when configured with the new Multi-Attach option, can be attached to a maximum of 16 EC2 instances in a single Availability Zone. Additionally, each Nitro-based EC2 instance can support the attachment of multiple Multi-Attach enabled EBS volumes. Multi-Attach capability makes it easier to achieve higher availability for applications that provide write-ordering to maintain storage consistency. You do not need to use enhanced networking to configure this option.</p>

<p><strong>To configure Direct Connect to reach speeds up to 25 Gbps between EC2 instances</strong> - AWS Direct Connect is a networking service that provides an alternative to using the internet to connect your on-premises resources to AWS Cloud. In many circumstances, private network connections can reduce costs, increase bandwidth, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections. You cannot use enhanced networking to configure Direct Connect to reach speeds up to 25 Gbps between EC2 instances.</p>

<p><strong>The append command overwrites the information from the first configuration file instead of appending to it</strong></p>

<p>You can set up the CloudWatch agent to use multiple configuration files. For example, you can use a common configuration file that collects a set of metrics and logs that you always want to collect from all servers in your infrastructure. You can then use additional configuration files that collect metrics from certain applications or in certain situations.</p>

<p>To set this up, first create the configuration files that you want to use. Any configuration files that will be used together on the same server must have different file names. You can store the configuration files on servers or in Parameter Store.</p>

<p>Start the CloudWatch agent using the <code>fetch-config</code> option and specify the first configuration file. To append the second configuration file to the running agent, use the same command but with the <code>append-config</code> option. All metrics and logs listed in either configuration file are collected.</p>

<p>Any configuration files appended to the configuration must have different file names from each other and from the initial configuration file. If you use <code>append-config</code> with a configuration file with the same file name as a configuration file that the agent is already using, the append command overwrites the information from the first configuration file instead of appending to it. This is true even if the two configuration files with the same file name are on different file paths.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Second configuration file parameters are added to the Agent already running with the first configuration file parameters</strong></p>

<p><strong>Two different Agents are started with different configurations, collecting the metrics and logs listed in either of the configuration files</strong></p>

<p><strong>A CloudWatch Agent can have only one configuration file and all required parameters are defined in this file alone</strong></p>

<p>These three options contradict the explanation provided above, so these options are incorrect.</p>

<p><strong>Scheduled events are managed by AWS, you cannot configure scheduled events for your instances</strong> - AWS can schedule events for your instances, such as a reboot, stop/start, or retirement. These events do not occur frequently. If one of your instances will be affected by a scheduled event, AWS sends an email to the email address that's associated with your AWS account before the scheduled event. The email provides details about the event, including the start and end date. Depending on the event, you might be able to take action to control the timing of the event. AWS also sends an AWS Health event, which you can monitor and manage using Amazon CloudWatch Events.</p>

<p>Scheduled events are managed by AWS; you cannot schedule events for your instances. You can view the events scheduled by AWS, customize scheduled event notifications to include or remove tags from the email notification, perform actions when an instance is scheduled to reboot, retire, or stop.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Use CloudWatch Alarm to configure scheduled events on Amazon EC2 instances</strong> - CloudWatch alarms can be used to watch a single metric over a time period you specify, and perform one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods. The action is a notification sent to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic or Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling policy. CloudWatch Alarm cannot be used to configure scheduled events on Amazon EC2 instances.</p>

<p><strong>Use Amazon EventBridge to configure scheduled events on Amazon EC2 instances</strong> - Amazon EventBridge helps automate your AWS services and respond automatically to system events. Events from AWS services are delivered to EventBridge in near real-time, and you can specify automated actions to take when an event matches a rule you write. EventBridge cannot be used to configure scheduled events on Amazon EC2 instances.</p>

<p><strong>Use CloudWatch Agent to configure scheduled events on Amazon EC2 instances</strong> - CloudWatch Agent helps collect logs and system-level metrics from both hosts and guests on your EC2 instances and on-premises servers. CloudWatch Agent cannot be used to configure scheduled events on Amazon EC2 instances.</p>

<p><strong>Create the AMI by disabling the <code>No reboot</code> option</strong> - On the <code>Create image</code> page, <code>No reboot</code> flag is present. The default functionality is, Amazon EC2 shuts down the instance, takes snapshots of any attached volumes, creates and registers the AMI, and then reboots the instance. When <code>No reboot</code> option is selected, the instance is not shut down while creating the AMI. This option is not selected by default.</p>

<p>If you select <code>No reboot</code>, the AMI will be crash-consistent (all the volumes are snapshotted at the same time), but not application-consistent (all the operating system buffers are not flushed to disk before the snapshots are created).</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Create the AMI with <code>No reboot</code> option enabled</strong> - If the <code>No reboot</code> flag is selected, the instance is not shutdown while creating an AMI. This implies, the Operating System buffers are not flushed before creating an AMI, so data integrity could be an issue with AMIs created in this way. Such AMIs are crash-consistent but not application-consistent.</p>

<p><strong>Create an EBS-backed AMI for application consistency</strong> - When you create a new instance from an EBS-backed AMI, you are using persistent storage. <code>No reboot</code> flag should still be unchecked to ensure that everything on the instance is stopped and in a consistent state during the creation process.</p>

<p><strong>Create the AMI with <code>Delete on termination</code> enabled</strong> - If you select <code>Delete on termination</code>, when you terminate the instance created from this AMI, the EBS volume is deleted. If you clear <code>Delete on termination</code>, when you terminate the instance, the EBS volume is not deleted. This option has been added as a distractor.</p>

<p><strong>Create identity-based IAM policy in the Finance account that allows the user to make a request to the S3 buckets in the HR and Audit accounts. Also, create resource-based IAM policies in the HR, Audit accounts that will allow the requester from the Finance account to access the respective S3 buckets</strong></p>

<p>Identity-based policies are attached to an IAM user, group, or role. These policies let you specify what that identity can do (its permissions).</p>

<p>Resource-based policies are attached to a resource. For example, you can attach resource-based policies to Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon SQS queues, and AWS Key Management Service encryption keys.</p>

<p>Identity-based policies and resource-based policies are both permissions policies and are evaluated together. For a request to which only permissions policies apply, AWS first checks all policies for a Deny. If one exists, then the request is denied. Then AWS checks for each Allow. If at least one policy statement allows the action in the request, the request is allowed. It doesn't matter whether the Allow is in the identity-based policy or the resource-based policy.</p>

<p>For requests made from one account to another, the requester in Account A must have an identity-based policy that allows them to make a request to the resource in Account B. Also, the resource-based policy in Account B must allow the requester in Account A to access the resource. There must be policies in both accounts that allow the operation, otherwise, the request fails.</p>

<p>Comparing IAM policies:

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Create resource-based policies in the HR, Audit accounts that will allow the requester from the Finance account to access the respective S3 buckets</strong> - Creating resource-based policy alone will be sufficient when the request is made within a single AWS account.</p>

<p><strong>Create resource-level permissions in the HR, Audit accounts to allow access to respective S3 buckets for the user in the Finance account</strong> - Resource-based policies differ from resource-level permissions. You can attach resource-based policies directly to a resource, as described in this topic. Resource-level permissions refer to the ability to use ARNs to specify individual resources in a policy. Resource-based policies are supported only by some AWS services.</p>

<p><strong>Create IAM roles in the HR, Audit accounts, which can be assumed by the user from the Finance account when the user needs to access the S3 buckets of the accounts</strong> - Cross-account access with a resource-based policy has some advantages over cross-account access with a role. With a resource that is accessed through a resource-based policy, the principal still works in the trusted account and does not have to give up his or her permissions to receive the role permissions. In other words, the principal continues to have access to resources in the trusted account at the same time as he or she has access to the resource in the trusting account. This is useful for tasks such as copying information to or from the shared resource in the other account.</p>

<p>We chose resource-based policy, so the user from the Finance account will continue to have access to resources in his own account while also getting permissions on resources from other accounts.</p>

<p><strong>Transfer the on-premises data into multiple Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices. Copy the Snowball Edge data into Amazon S3 and create a lifecycle policy to transition the data into AWS Glacier</strong></p>

<p>Snowball Edge Storage Optimized is the optimal choice if you need to securely and quickly transfer dozens of terabytes to petabytes of data to AWS. It provides up to 80 TB of usable HDD storage, 40 vCPUs, 1 TB of SATA SSD storage, and up to 40 Gb network connectivity to address large scale data transfer and pre-processing use cases.
The data stored on the Snowball Edge device can be copied into the S3 bucket and later transitioned into AWS Glacier via a lifecycle policy. You can't directly copy data from Snowball Edge devices into AWS Glacier.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Transfer the on-premises data into multiple Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices. Copy the Snowball Edge data into AWS Glacier</strong> - As mentioned earlier, you can't directly copy data from Snowball Edge devices into AWS Glacier. Hence, this option is incorrect.</p>

<p><strong>Setup AWS direct connect between the on-premises data center and AWS Cloud. Use this connection to transfer the data into AWS Glacier</strong> - AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations. Using industry-standard 802.1q VLANs, this dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces. Direct Connect involves significant monetary investment and takes more than a month to set up, therefore it's not the correct fit for this use-case where just a one-time data transfer has to be done.</p>

<p><strong>Setup Site-to-Site VPN connection between the on-premises data center and AWS Cloud. Use this connection to transfer the data into AWS Glacier</strong> - AWS Site-to-Site VPN enables you to securely connect your on-premises network or branch office site to your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). VPN Connections are a good solution if you have an immediate need, and have low to modest bandwidth requirements. Because of the high data volume for the given use-case, Site-to-Site VPN is not the correct choice.</p>

<p><strong>If an IAM user, with full access to IAM and Amazon S3, assigns a bucket policy to an Amazon S3 bucket and doesn't specify the AWS account root user as a principal, the root user is denied access to that bucket</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes, you might have an IAM user with full access to IAM and Amazon S3. If the IAM user assigns a bucket policy to an Amazon S3 bucket and doesn't specify the AWS account root user as a principal, the root user is denied access to that bucket. However, as the root user, you can still access the bucket. To do that, modify the bucket policy to allow root user access from the Amazon S3 console or the AWS CLI. Use the following principal, replacing 123456789012 with the ID of the AWS account.</p>

<p><code>"Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root" }</code></p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Root user always has access to all the resources of the account. The Amazon S3 bucket could be from another AWS account and the S3 bucket has been shared with the root user and hence appears in his list of S3 buckets</strong></p>

<p><strong>An Amazon S3 bucket policy that specifies a wildcard (*) in the principal element, sometimes is declared void by AWS to avoid the risk of complete public exposure. Such S3 buckets policies are in invalid status and have random behavior</strong></p>

<p><strong>Root user has access to all the resources in his AWS account. Contact AWS support to resolve the access issue</strong></p>

<p>These three options contradict the explanation above, so these options are incorrect.</p>

<p><strong>The Auto Scaling group in your Elastic Beanstalk environment uses two default Amazon CloudWatch alarms to trigger scaling operations. These alarms must be configured based on the parameters appropriate for your application</strong></p>

<p>The Auto Scaling group in your Elastic Beanstalk environment uses two Amazon CloudWatch alarms to trigger scaling operations. Default Auto Scaling triggers are configured to scale when the average outbound network traffic (NetworkOut) from each instance is higher than 6 MB or lower than 2 MB over a period of five minutes.</p>

<p>For more efficient Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, configure triggers that are appropriate for your application, instance type, and service requirements. You can scale based on several statistics including latency, disk I/O, CPU utilization, and request count.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>The IAM Role attached to the Auto Scaling group might not have enough permissions to scale instances on-demand</strong> - The Auto Scaling group will not be able to spin up Amazon EC2 instances if the IAM Role associated with Beanstalk does not have enough permissions. Since the current use-case talks about scaling not happening at the expected rate, this should not be the issue.</p>

<p><strong>By default, Auto Scaling group created from Beanstalk uses Elastic Load Balancing health checks. Configure the Beanstalk to use Amazon EC2 status checks</strong> - This statement is incorrect. By default, Auto Scaling group created from Beanstalk uses Amazon EC2 status checks.</p>

<p><strong>The Auto Scaling group in your Elastic Beanstalk environment uses the number of logged-in users, as the criteria to trigger auto-scaling action. These alarms must be configured based on the parameters appropriate for your application</strong> - The default scaling criteria has already been discussed above (and it is not the number of logged-in users).</p>

<p><strong>Use CloudFormation StackSets with AWS Organizations to deploy and manage IAM roles to multiple AWS accounts simultaneously</strong></p>

<p>CloudFormation StackSets allow you to roll out CloudFormation stacks over multiple AWS accounts and in multiple Regions with just a couple of clicks. When AWS launched StackSets, grouping accounts was primarily for billing purposes. Since the launch of AWS Organizations, you can centrally manage multiple AWS accounts across diverse business needs including billing, access control, compliance, security and resource sharing.</p>

<p>You can now centrally orchestrate any AWS CloudFormation enabled service across multiple AWS accounts and regions. For example, you can deploy your centralized AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles, provision Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances or AWS Lambda functions across AWS Regions and accounts in your organization. CloudFormation StackSets simplify the configuration of cross-accounts permissions and allow for automatic creation and deletion of resources when accounts are joining or are removed from your Organization.</p>

<p>You can get started by enabling data sharing between CloudFormation and Organizations from the StackSets console. Once done, you will be able to use StackSets in the Organizations master account to deploy stacks to all accounts in your organization or in specific organizational units (OUs). A new service managed permission model is available with these StackSets. Choosing Service managed permissions allows StackSets to automatically configure the necessary IAM permissions required to deploy your stack to the accounts in your organization.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Create CloudFormation templates and reuse them to create necessary IAM roles in each of the AWS accounts</strong> - CloudFormation templates can ease the current manual process that the company is using. However, it's not a completely automated process that the company needs.</p>

<p><strong>Use AWS Directory Service with AWS Organizations to automatically associate necessary IAM roles with the Microsoft Active Directory users</strong> - AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory, or AWS Managed Microsoft AD, lets you run Microsoft Active Directory (AD) as a managed service. AWS Directory Service makes it easy to set up and run directories in the AWS Cloud or connect your AWS resources with an existing on-premises Microsoft Active Directory. It is not meant for the automatic creation of IAM roles across AWS accounts.</p>

<p><strong>Use AWS Resource Access Manager that integrates with AWS Organizations to deploy and manage shared resources across AWS accounts</strong> - AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) enables you to share specified AWS resources that you own with other AWS accounts. It's a centralized service that provides a consistent experience for sharing different types of AWS resources across multiple accounts. This service enables you to share resources across AWS accounts. It's not meant for re-creating the same resource definitions in different AWS accounts.</p>

<p><strong>Use an Elastic Beanstalk blue (environment A)/green (environment B) deployment to decouple the RDS DB instance from environment A. Create a new Elastic Beanstalk environment (environment B) with the necessary information to connect to the decouple RDS DB instance</strong> - Attaching an RDS DB instance to an Elastic Beanstalk environment is ideal for development and testing environments. However, it's not recommended for production environments because the lifecycle of the database instance is tied to the lifecycle of your application environment. If you terminate the environment, then you lose your data because the RDS DB instance is deleted by the environment.</p>

<p>Since the current use case mentions not having downtime on the database, we can follow these steps for resolution:
1. Use an Elastic Beanstalk blue (environment A)/green (environment B) deployment to decouple an RDS DB instance from environment A. Create an RDS DB snapshot and enable <code>Deletion protection</code> on the DB instance to Safeguard your RDS DB instance from deletion.
2. Create a new Elastic Beanstalk environment (environment B) with the necessary information to connect to the RDS DB instance. Your new Elastic Beanstalk environment (environment B) must not include an RDS DB instance in the same Elastic Beanstalk application.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>Since it is a test environment, take a snapshot of the database and terminate the current environment. Create a new one without attaching an RDS instance directly to it (from the snapshot)</strong> - It is mentioned in the problem statement that the company is looking at a solution with no downtime. Hence, this is an incorrect option.</p>

<p><strong>Use an Elastic Beanstalk Immutable deployment to make the entire architecture completely reliable. You can terminate the first environment whenever you are confident of the second environment working correctly</strong> - Immutable deployments perform an immutable update to launch a full set of new instances running the new version of the application in a separate Auto Scaling group, alongside the instances running the old version. Immutable deployments can prevent issues caused by partially completed rolling deployments. If the new instances don't pass health checks, Elastic Beanstalk terminates them, leaving the original instances untouched. This solution is an over-kill for the test environment, even if the company is looking at a no-downtime option.</p>

<p><strong>Decoupling an RDS instance that is part of a running Elastic Beanstalk environment is not currently supported by AWS. You will need to terminate the current environment after taking the snapshot of the database and create a new one with RDS configured outside the environment</strong> - This is a made-up option and given only as a distractor.</p>

<p><strong>To automate the replacement of unhealthy EC2 instances, you must change the health check type of your instance's Auto Scaling group from EC2 to ELB by using a configuration file of your Beanstalk environment</strong></p>

<p>By default, the health check configuration of your Auto Scaling group is set as an EC2 type that performs a status check of EC2 instances. To automate the replacement of unhealthy EC2 instances, you must change the health check type of your instance's Auto Scaling group from EC2 to ELB by using a configuration file.</p>

<p>The following are some important points to remember:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Status checks cover only an EC2 instance's health, and not the health of your application, server, or any Docker containers running on the instance.</p></li>
<li><p>If your application crashes, the load balancer removes the unhealthy instances from its target. However, your Auto Scaling group doesn't automatically replace the unhealthy instances marked by the load balancer.</p></li>
<li><p>By changing the health check type of your Auto Scaling group from EC2 to ELB, you enable the Auto Scaling group to automatically replace the unhealthy instances when the health check fails.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Complete list of steps to configure the above:

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>To automate the replacement of unhealthy EC2 instances, you must change the health check type of your instance's Auto Scaling group from ELB to EC2 by using a configuration file of your Beanstalk environment</strong> - As mentioned earlier, the health check type of your instance's Auto Scaling group should be changed from EC2 to ELB.</p>

<p><strong>Modify the Auto Scaling Group from Amazon EC2 console directly to change the health check type to ELB</strong></p>

<p><strong>Modify the Auto Scaling Group from Amazon EC2 console directly to change the health check type to EC2</strong></p>

<p>You should configure your Amazon EC2 instances in an Elastic Beanstalk environment by using Elastic Beanstalk configuration files (.ebextensions). Configuration changes made to your Elastic Beanstalk environment won't persist if you use the following configuration methods:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Configuring an Elastic Beanstalk resource directly from the console of a specific AWS service.</p></li>
<li><p>Installing a package, creating a file, or running a command directly from your Amazon EC2 instance.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Both these options contradict the above explanation and therefore these two options are incorrect.</p>

<p><strong>Check that the device name you specified when you attempted to attach the EBS volume isn't already in use. Attempt to attach the volume to the instance, again, but use a different device name</strong></p>

<p>Check that the device name you specified when you attempted to attach the EBS volume isn't already in use. If the specified device name is already being used by the block device driver of the EC2 instance, the operation fails.</p>

<p>When attaching an EBS volume to an Amazon EC2 instance, you can specify a device name for the volume (by default, one is filled in for you). The block device driver of the EC2 instance mounts the volume and assigns a name. The volume name can be different from the name that you assign.</p>

<p>If you specify a device name that's not in use by Amazon EC2, but is used by the block device driver within the EC2 instance, the attachment of the Amazon EBS volume fails. Instead, the EBS volume is stuck in the attaching state. This is usually due to one of the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The block device driver is remapping the specified device name: On an HVM EC2 instance, /dev/sda1 remaps to /dev/xvda. If you attempt to attach a secondary Amazon EBS volume to /dev/xvda, the secondary EBS volume can't successfully attach to the instance. This can cause the EBS volume to be stuck in the attaching state.</p></li>
<li><p>The block device driver didn't release the device name: If a user has initiated a forced detach of an Amazon EBS volume, the block device driver of the Amazon EC2 instance might not immediately release the device name for reuse. Attempting to use that device name when attaching a volume causes the volume to be stuck in the attaching state. You must either choose a different device name or reboot the instance.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You can resolve most issues with volumes stuck in the attaching state by following these steps: Force detach the volume and attempt to attach the volume to the instance, again, but use a different device name. The instance must be in running state for this to work.</p>

<p>If the above does not solve the problem, you can reboot the instance or stop and start the instance to migrate it to new underlying hardware. Keep in mind that instance store data is lost when you stop and start an instance.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>The EBS volume could be encrypted and the custom KMS key used to encrypt the snapshot is missing. The custom KMS key needs to be added to the volume configuration</strong> - A missing KMS key will not lead to <code>attaching</code> state of the volume.</p>

<p><strong>Each EBS volume receives an initial I/O credit balance, an error in accumulating the credit balance can stop the volume from attaching properly to the instance. Restart the instance to fix the error</strong> - This is a made-up option and has been added as a distractor.</p>

<p><strong>The <code>attaching</code> status indicates that the underlying hardware related to your EBS volume has failed. This issue cannot be fixed. Raise a service request on AWS and request for a new volume. You are not charged for volumes that are in error state</strong> - When the underlying hardware related to your EBS volume has failed, the EBS volume will have a status of <code>error</code>. The data associated with the volume is unrecoverable and Amazon EBS processes the volume as lost. AWS doesn't bill for volumes with a status of <code>error</code>.</p>

By default, Storage Gateway uses Amazon S3-Managed Encryption Keys to server-side encrypt all data it stores in Amazon S3</strong></p>

<p>AWS Storage Gateway uses SSL/TLS (Secure Socket Layers/Transport Layer Security) to encrypt data that is transferred between your gateway appliance and AWS storage. By default, Storage Gateway uses Amazon S3-Managed Encryption Keys (SSE-S3) to server-side encrypt all data it stores in Amazon S3. You have an option to use the Storage Gateway API to configure your gateway to encrypt data stored in the cloud using server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) customer master keys (CMKs).</p>

<p>File, Volume and Tape Gateway data is stored in Amazon S3 buckets by AWS Storage Gateway. Tape Gateway supports backing data to Amazon S3 Glacier apart from the standard storage.</p>

<p>Encrypting a file share: For a file share, you can configure your gateway to encrypt your objects with AWS KMS–managed keys by using SSE-KMS.</p>

<p>Encrypting a volume: For cached and stored volumes, you can configure your gateway to encrypt volume data stored in the cloud with AWS KMS–managed keys by using the Storage Gateway API.</p>

<p>Encrypting a tape: For a virtual tape, you can configure your gateway to encrypt tape data stored in the cloud with AWS KMS–managed keys by using the Storage Gateway API.</p>

<p>Incorrect options:</p>

<p><strong>AWS Storage Gateway uses IPsec to encrypt data that is transferred between your gateway appliance and AWS storage. File and Volume Gateway data stored on Amazon S3 is encrypted. Tape Gateway data cannot be encrypted at-rest</strong></p>

<p><strong>AWS Storage Gateway uses IPsec to encrypt data that is transferred between your gateway appliance and AWS storage. All three Gateway types store data in encrypted form at-rest</strong></p>

<p>There is no such thing as using IPSec for encrypting in-transit data between your gateway appliance and AWS storage. You need to use SSL/TLS for this. So both these options are incorrect.</p>

<p><strong>AWS Storage Gateway uses SSL/TLS (Secure Socket Layers/Transport Layer Security) to encrypt data that is transferred between your gateway appliance and AWS storage.
