Which factors should be considered when selecting a Region? (Select TWO.)

Compliance with data governance and legal requirements

Proximity to your customers

Access to 24/7 technical support

Ability to assign custom permissions to different users

    Compliance with data governance and legal requirements
    Proximity to your customers

Two other factors to consider when selecting a Region are pricing and the services that are available in a Region.

 

The other response options are incorrect because:

    The level of support that you choose is not determined by Region. AWS Support plans are explored later in this course.
    Assigning custom permissions to different users is a feature that is possible in all AWS Regions.
    The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is available in all AWS Regions.

Which statement best describes Amazon CloudFront?

A service that enables you to run infrastructure in a hybrid cloud approach

A serverless compute engine for containers

A service that enables you to send and receive messages between software components through a queue

A global content delivery service

Incorrect

The correct response option is A global content delivery service.

 

Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery service. It uses a network of edge locations to cache content and deliver content to customers all over the world. When content is cached, it is stored locally as a copy. This content might be video files, photos, webpages, and so on.

 

The other response options are incorrect because:

    AWS Outposts is a service that enables you to run infrastructure in a hybrid cloud approach.
    AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers.
    Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) is a service that enables you to send, store, and receive messages between software components through a queue.

Region

Availability Zone

Edge location

Incorrect

The correct response option is Edge location.

 

The other response options are incorrect because:

    A Region is a separate geographical location with multiple locations that are isolated from each other.
    An Availability Zone is a fully isolated portion of the AWS global infrastructure.
    An origin is the server from which CloudFront gets your files. Examples of CloudFront origins include Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets and web servers. Note: Amazon S3 is explored later in this course.
